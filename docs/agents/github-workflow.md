# Git And PR Workflow

- Use `gh` for GitHub operations (repo, issues, PRs, releases, checks).
- Use Conventional Commits (for example: `feat: add launch plan`).
- Keep commits atomic: one logical change per commit.
- Avoid bundling unrelated edits in the same commit.
- PRs should include:
  - short description
  - linked issue
  - test results
  - screenshots for UI changes
